notes on final project

Based on your design document, I am reasonably confident as to your ability to complete 
the final project successfully, but I have some concerns.

You have detailed some useful small problems into which you can break your project, 
but left out some important ones. For example, how will you determine which language is most similar to the query? 
How will you represent the trigram frequencies for a language? How will you associate the name of a language with its trigram frequencies?

You've said a few things in your description of your language class that concern me. You've got several vectors, 
but you haven't said what they contain. Remember that std::vector is a templated type; you can't just have a std::vector, 
it has to be a std::vector of integers, or of some other concrete type.

You also appear to be storing the entire text of each language document in the language object. 
Ask yourself why you're doing this. Do you need it later? Or can you just compute trigram frequencies while reading the file?

For milestone 1, you state that you'll create an input file stream. 
There's no file I/O in milestone 1; you read a string from the command line. File I/O is only in milestone 2.

For milestone 2, you say you'll return the object with the highest frequency. 
But that's not correct. You want to print out the name of the language (file) that is *most similar* to the query.
